# StaticMatic JS Starter App

Includes:

- Underscore.js 1.4.3
- Backbone.js 0.9.9
- jQuery 1.8.3

To use:

    $ staticmatic add js-app git://github.com/mindeavor/staticmatic-js-app-starter.git
    $ staticmatic init my-new-project --skeleton=js-app

The first line stores a named reference (`js-app`) to a repository of your choosing. You only need to do this once.

The second line clones the referenced repository into a freshly created `my-new-project` folder, as well as removes the `.git/` folder so you can do your own `git init`.
